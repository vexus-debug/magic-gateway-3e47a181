# Roadmap

- [x] Redesign the staff page with compact mobile-friendly directory cards.
- [x] Keep Add Staff, help, staff details, status, role, phone, and visible Edit actions.
- [x] Automatically send staff assigned to one sub-branch into that branch after login.
- [x] Verify the redesigned staff directory layout at desktop and phone sizes; branch routing is source-verified because this external login cannot be automated here.
- [x] Retire the installed app's old offline cache so the redesigned staff page replaces the previous layout.
- [x] Create owner, dentist, and receptionist dental dashboard views.
- [x] Add the day card, scrollable KPI strip, sparklines, action-first cards, and daily insight.
- [x] Add the empty-clinic onboarding checklist and odontogram empty state.
- [x] Verify the upgraded dental dashboard at desktop and phone sizes.
- [x] Replace public-page dashboard screenshots with matching snapshots of the current dashboard while leaving tutorial pages unchanged.- [x] Keep the patient locked in the link across chart, treatments, prescriptions, consent and profile.
- [x] One-tap check-in from appointment details and the daily calendar; Start Visit opens the chart.
- [x] Waiting list shortcuts to Chart/Plan/Notes, plus checkout after Done.
- [x] Chart findings can be added to the treatment plan with the catalog price.
- [x] Finish-visit panel: review billables, attach prescriptions, send to billing, book the next visit.

## Dentist flow fixes
- [x] Visit context persists across sidebar navigation

- [x] Profile: Start Visit + Dental chart link
- [x] Appointments: My schedule filter; booking conflict warning

## Dentist workflow blueprint (zero double-entry)
